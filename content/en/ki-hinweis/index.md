## AI can help—but it comes with risks
Tools like ChatGPT can assist with brainstorming, outlining, and wording. It becomes risky when AI is used uncritically to generate claims, invent sources, or is used in assessment contexts where disclosure is required.

### Common risks
- **Hallucinations** (plausible but incorrect facts)  
- **Fake references** (invented citations/DOIs)  
- **Plagiarism & policy risks** (unclear authorship)  
- **Loss of voice** (generic tone)

## Our approach
We help you use AI as a tool—while human experience, common sense, and empathy ensure quality and safety.
